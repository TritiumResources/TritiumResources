				# About
The Leftist Lockbox is a site run by one person in an effort to make a difference. One person cannot fix everything, but one can at least make sure information winds up in the right hands.

Currently, this site is mostly about on Human Rights and Climate Change, though more topics may come up in the future as more resources are compiled.

Given President Trump's recent actions, the coming resources will largely focus on Transgender Rights in the USA. If, however, you have found this site and wish for more coverage regarding other events that have slipped under my radar, reach out to me through the [contact](questions.html) page.
