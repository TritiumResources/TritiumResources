Your first instinct might be to push upwards.
Don't do that - this can convert it into a choke hold, which is worse for you.

1. Instead, grab from the bottom, like a hook, and pull downwards.

2. Raise one of your shoulders and its respective elbow.

3. This should create an opening, which you can twist out of.

4. If they manage to get you in a choke hold, pull downwards as mentioned before and scrunch your neck downwards to make it harder to grab.
