# How Fake News spreads and how to stop it

I was doomscrolling on twitter.com – everything was just as bad as usual. Then this tweet came up.

For those of you out of the loop, Imane Khelif (born intersex, assigned female at birth) won a boxing match and is now being accused of a trans woman because she looks slightly too masculine and hits hard in a competition with the world's hardest hitters. This is obviously nonsense, and a lotta people are rightfully calling it out as nonsense.

People are also bringing up that there aren't any trans people at the olympics \*except\* for a trans man from the Philippines. Hergie Bacyadan. The subject of this tweet.

This article headline seemed odd to me – there are trans people who turn against other trans people because of internalized transphobia and societal pressure, but it isn’t _that_ common for us to throw each other under the bus. So I looked at the Dailymail article itself. And this line was interesting to me.

This strikes me as odd because they didn’t cite the part where he says that athletes with XY chromosomes shouldn't fight "biological females". They cited literally everything else, including the part where he says that he doesn't want to go on Testosterone (his Instagram), but not the line the entire article hinges on. Normally, you'd say "in an interview from CNN" or "in this video (hyperlink)" or "in an interview from our own reporters at Daily Mail", but there's just some interview that exists in the ether.

This seemed strange, so I checked through several articles, and every single time it was the same thing. It's some variant of "He said that people with XY chromosomes can't fight 'biological females', based on something that some reporters/translators said", but they don't cite the reporters or link a video and when they _do_ cite it, it's a link to Daily Mail which we've already established didn't cite its source. But they do cite _everything_ else including the fact that he isn't on Testosterone by linking to his Instagram!

In one of these articles, they even cited the damn Olympics as an event instead of linking an interview.

Eventually, I found an article on sportskeeda that cited someone new – Nine. An Australian news site.

But this didn’t help either – they didn’t link an interview, say “our reporters”, or anything. There’s just _some_ interview out in lala land where Hergie Bacyadan said this.

I checked his Instagram and found nothing. I checked his TikTok and found nothing. I downloaded a VPN and watched Philippines-exclusive videos and interviews with him from One Sports, but there nothing even remotely close to the claims came up. This line was pretty funny though.
![Screenshot of an article that says "Hergie stated no preference regarding his pronouns, but explained that he has always felt that he was a man. He has also said that he was attracted to women - he is married to Lady Denily Diego (sorry to disappoint all the people online thirsting over him!)"](Resources/BacyadanImg/funny-line.png)
I was going nuts – this had eaten up almost my entire weekend, and I just needed answers. The misinformation was starting to circulate in online LGBT circles, which is the worst place for it to circle. It’s absolutely devastating to “learn” that the only trans man at the Olympics wasn’t supportive of the rest of us.

![Screenshot of a reddit exchange where a Redditor accuses Hergie Bacyadan of saying that athletes with XY chromosomes should not be allowed to compete in womens competition. ](Resources/BacyadanImg/reddit-thread.png)
Then my mom suggested that I just ask Bacyadan himself. I don’t know why this didn’t occur to me – it should’ve been the first thing I did. So I emailed him, and got immediate confirmation that it was fake. Then a few hours later, I see a post on his Instagram denying the allegations and throwing his full support behind Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-Ting.

This would’ve been the end, but I knew that this wouldn’t have nearly the same reach as the Daily Mail article, the Twitter posts, and the other news articles that I found quoting the same misinformation. I emailed each of the news sites and requested that they correct the misinformation. I was pleasantly surprised when the Daily Mail was the first to correct it. I reached out to [Nine](https://www.nine.com.au/sport/olympics/paris-2024-philippines-fighter-hergie-bacyadan-says-xy-chromosome-boxers-should-not-be-allowed-to-compete-against-females-20240801-p5jyh8.html), [Express](https://www.express.co.uk/sport/othersport/1931175/Olympics-Imane-Khelif-transgender-boxer-Hergie-Bacyadan), [ABC](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-08-01/paris-olympic-games-caitlin-parker-questions-boxing-gender-call/104167748), [firstsportz](https://firstsportz.com/australian-boxer-caitlin-parker-calls-out-inclusion-of-transgender-athletes-women-sports/), [sportskeeda](https://www.sportskeeda.com/us/olympics/news-amidst-gender-controversy-paris-olympics-2024-openly-trans-boxer-comes-athletes-born-xy-chromosomes-competing-women-s-category), [adelaidnow](https://www.adelaidenow.com.au/sport/olympics/2024-paris-olympic-games-gender-debate-rages-in-combat-sports/news-story/a4714aa1ac80e64f3e9e0869195da8d7?amp&nk=489512b67eae53fa0d17adedfbc80e87-1722772065), [heraldsun](https://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/olympics/2024-paris-olympic-games-gender-debate-rages-in-combat-sports/news-story/a4714aa1ac80e64f3e9e0869195da8d7?amp&nk=489512b67eae53fa0d17adedfbc80e87-1722772138), [taipei times](https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2024/08/02/2003821665), and the [Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/olympics/article-13701255/Hergie-Bacyadan-female-boxer-identifies-man-calls-fighters-fail-gender-tests-banned-Imane-Khelif-Lin-Yu-ting-Angela-Carini-Paris-Olympics.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=social-twitter_dailymailsport). So far, Express, the Daily Mail, and Sportskeeda were only ones to correct the misinformation. There’s some fun meta-analysis to be done here – the earliest articles spreading this misinformation were also worded in more transphobic/problematic ways, and they still haven’t corrected their articles yet.

Then I went after the social media posts spreading the misinformation. The Twitter posts were easy – you can request community notes on posts that’re misleading and if your community note is approved, it’ll notify everyone who’d previously interacted with the tweet. There’s a huge issue where a tweet blows up but then tweets correcting the original don’t get nearly as much traction, even if they’re from the same user, and the community note notification thing solves that issue.

The only problem was that I couldn’t write community notes – I could only request them. One user deleted their tweet, which was nice, but it still meant that nobody received the correct information. I’m still waiting on the community note for the first tweet I saw.

The Reddit comment was an entire other mess. Simple replying to the original commenter wasn’t gonna do anything – the post was a few days old and after the first day, it’s basically guaranteed that nobody sees it again. I tried making a new post in the same subreddit, but the auto bot prevented me from posting it.

This was, of course, hilarious. It’s _absolutely_ an appropriate subreddit for the post, especially because the misinformation was spread on that same subreddit. Eventually, I gave up on fighting the mods and settled for replying to the comment spreading the misinformation. And then my comment got deleted because I cited my sources!

At first, the takeaways seem pessimistic. It took hours of my life to verify this _one_ thing and _days_ attempting to try and correct it and get the right information to the people who had read the posts repeating the fake news. It’s no wonder that fake news spreads so easily – all of this was for correcting _one_ thing.

On top of that, the very people who you’re trying to help sometimes undermine your ability to correct that misinformation. You literally cannot win.

However, it does show that correcting misinformation isn’t just for professional investigative journalists. Any of us can do it with a search engine and some time. If you feel like an article isn’t accurate or that there’s something off about it, investigate it! You might just find something worthwhile. And finding the right information isn’t rocket science either – sometimes, it’s as simple as a single email. We have the tools to combat fake news – we just need to use them.
